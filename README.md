# cryptoEEZ
App that calculates your win/loss in crypto trading, as well as other additional information.

Very early stage in development!

The app uses crypto current information from Coingecko API. User adds information on when he bought, at what price and what crypto. Then the information is calculated on win/loss, date created, balance on the trading transaction, other.

A user can be created, can login, logout and has coockie/session. Deleating a user is now implemented yet. Each individual user transaction is shown when logged in. A user cannot see other users transactions!

UI is crude, but visualisation was made to display the information on transactions.

Further changes will be registered in this readme
